The internet is plagued by an overwhelming amount of information, with a staggering majority being irrelevant or misleading. The signal-to-noise ratio is alarmingly low. A typical website visited by the average user is infested with around 25-30 trackers from advertising sites, with doubleclick.net being a prime culprit. It's astonishing that domains like doubleclick.net and googlesyndication.com consistently rank among the top 100 most queried domains.

Personally, I use the Orion browser, which effectively blocks these trackers by default. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a cleaner browsing experience.

The internet advertising market is a behemoth, largely dominated by two major players. I refer to this market as the attention market, as it revolves around capturing users' attention. The monetary scale of this market is grossly underestimated by most. To put this into perspective, let's examine the quarterly income statements of the world's largest advertising companies:

**Google Q1 2024 ($2.1 trillion market cap)**
- Google generated approximately $62 billion in ad revenue in a single quarter.
  - $46 billion from search
  - $8 billion from YouTube
  - $7 billion from Google Search Network
- resulting in a profit of $28 billion solely from advertising.

**Meta Q1 2024 ($1.2 trillion market cap)**
- Meta earned $36 billion in ad revenue
- Meta profited $12 billion from advertising
- Meta boasted nearly 3 billion daily active users

**Snapchat Q1 2024 ($21 billion market cap)**
- Snapchat generated $1.2 billion in revenue
- Snapchat suffered a loss of $300 million
- Snapchat had 400 million daily active users
