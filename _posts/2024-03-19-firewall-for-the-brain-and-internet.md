There is too much information on the internet, most of which is total trash. The signal-to-noise ratio is abysmal. The average website that most common people visit has upwards of 25-30 trackers by ad sites, most likely doubleclick.net. How crazy is it that domains like doubleclick.net and googlesyndication.com are literally in the top 100 domains queried by people?

I personally use the Orion browser, which blocks all these by default. I would highly recommend it.

Internet advertising is a mind-bogglingly huge market because of the way it's structured, and currently, only two companies own most of it. I like to call the advertising market the attention market. Most people severely underestimate how huge this is monetarily. To get an idea, let's look at the income statements of the biggest ad companies in the world:

**Google Q1 2024 ($2.1 trillion market cap)**
- Google made roughly $62 billion in revenue through ads in a single quarter.
  - $46 billion through search
  - $8 billion through YouTube
  - $7 billion through Google Search Network
- leading to $28 billion in profit from advertising alone.

**Meta Q1 2024 ($1.2 trillion market cap)**
- Meta made $36 billion in revenue through advertising
- Meta made $12 billion in profit through advertising
- Meta had close to 3 billion daily active users

**Snapchat Q1 2024 ($21 billion market cap)**
- Snapchat made $1.2 billion in revenue
- Snapchat had $300 million down the hole in losses
- Snapchat had 400 million daily active users

Combined this companies made close to 100 billion in revene from advertising in a single quater yes billion with a B and quater with a q.
